# ad-employee-separation-robot
Script I've made for our Hybrid O365 environment. It prompts the user for information and does some AD stuff in the background. Will be improving on it over time.

Future improvements:

Automatically get the OU the disabled account needs to be moved to based on current OU.
Make it so PS automatically enters in the date so I can get rid of the user prompt.
Make the script automatically disable "automatically update email addresses" on exchange.
Export user's emails(?)
